//! The CUDA libraries the music engine is linked against.
//!
//! The engine loads one of two CUDA backends at run time, `cuda13\ggml-cuda.dll`
//! or `cuda12\ggml-cuda.dll`, whichever the card and its driver run (see
//! `cuda_build`). Each imports its own cuBLAS, `cublas64_13.dll` or
//! `cublas64_12.dll`, which imports `cublasLt64_1x.dll`. The loader resolves
//! them from the executable's folder, so they go beside `mm-server.exe`, and
//! the two majors never clash by name. A missing cuBLAS fails the backend
//! load, and the engine stops on it.
//!
//! The two libraries are 512 MB unpacked, which is four times the rest of the
//! installer, so they are not shipped - they are fetched from NVIDIA's own
//! redistributable archive the first time the engine is asked to start, the
//! same way the models are. The build machine has them on PATH through the CUDA
//! Toolkit, which is exactly why this was invisible until someone without the
//! Toolkit ran the release.
